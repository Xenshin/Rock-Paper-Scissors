# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This code uses a while loop to continuously play the game until the user decides to quit. Inside the loop, it uses the input() function to get the user's choice, converts it to lowercase, and then uses an if-else statement to check if it's a valid input or not. Then it uses the random.choice() function to randomly generate the computer's choice and compares it with the user's choice to determine the winner. It also keeps track of the score and asks the user if he wants to play again.
